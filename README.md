# backbone-react-flux-todoapp
A basic todo list application using Backbone, React and the Flux design pattern

You need to download the repo. Then install:

  - npm install

Then you need to run a gulp command to compile the code. (NOTE: It is best to install gulp globally first: npm install -global gulp)

  - gulp

Running gulp will do the following:

  - lint your code
  - Compile the tests
  - Bundle the tests
  - Run the tests
  - Compile the code (compiles JSX, LESS/SASS and moves to the build folder)
  - Builds the code (bundles, minifies, uglyfies and moves to public)

Then you can open the index.html generated in the public folder.
